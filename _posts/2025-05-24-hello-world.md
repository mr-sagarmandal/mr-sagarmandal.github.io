Its 5.24.2025 and this is my first post here. Started this to share my technical journey specifically working with artificial intelligence models and incorporating it in my work.

In my short life as a developer, this is probably the most transformative time I have experienced in the industry. It is scary that these tools brings about the possibility of turning my line of work redundant in the future. Reminds me of the second season of The Wire, where an union leader was fighting hard to prevent their work from being taken over by superior automated technologies. 

Even with this backdrop, I cannot help but be very excited.
